## Personal Portfolio
This is my most recent portfolio, and it's live [HERE](https://zimvomatwa.github.io/whoiszimvo/). My old one is here [There](https://zimvomatwa.github.io/) **by the time you see this it might have nothing but a "coming soon" message.

### Stacks
<p>This was my first time using SASS(SCSS) and I really liked it, my code is usually really messy by the time I'm done with the first section/div and SASS is very useful in writing clean code than doesn't confuse me a month later, and I hated descendent selectors anyway</p>
